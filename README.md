Inventory Management System

This system allows you to create, read, update and delete customers, items and orders. The previous functions listed are able to be carried out via a command line interface. During this project, Java, Eclipse, Agile, MySQL, Maven, Junit and Github were all utilised to ensure a structured approach.

## Getting Started

In order to use this system, you must first create a local repository on your device and clone this remote repository to the local one. Once done, you should have all the files needed to be able to use the system.

### Prerequisites

GitBash – To clone the remote repository to your local repository.
